Abstract
========

The SSI community has described several groundbreaking properties that
come along with the adoption of its principles; "Who decides? Who
decides who decides?" (Shoshana Zuboff
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IcU9w9STAo]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IcU9w9STAo)
). However, even though the technology has matured greatly over recent
years, bootstrapping an SSI trust framework within the existing
capitalistic market environment is complicated and has not been achieved
within any functional domain at scale. In this paper, we apply the SWOT
framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threads) to
identify potential paths to adoption. For example, what are the general
implications of introducing a credential holder into existing
issuer/verifier relationships? Furthermore, we apply the discovered
outcomes to a domain-specific use case (US healthcare).

Introduction
============

Problems:

-   The transition from Standards to Implementation / Product is
    complicated

    a.  Grants

    b.  Incentivizing developers

    c.  Capital (Token Funding / Crowd Funding)

    d.  Scaling

    e.  Exit (principles be gone)

Mention exemplary Use-Case of the US Medical system in order to lead the
reader towards the SWOT analysis and make him/her relate to the status
quo.

Describing Challenges in an example use case
[[https://w3c.github.io/vc-use-cases/\#healthcare]{.underline}](https://w3c.github.io/vc-use-cases/#healthcare)
:

-   Doctor issues prescription to patient

-   Patient presents proof of prescription

-   Pharmacy validates prescription

SWOT Analysis:
==============

This paper applies the SWOT Analysis, a strategic planning technique
that can help an individual or an organization in determining Strengths,
Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threads ("SWOT") in to identify possible
paths.

SWOT analysis may be used in any decision-making situation when a
desired end-state (objective) is defined.

Strengths
---------

-   Avoiding an enterprise sale - adoption can be decentralized, one
    doctor, one patient at a time. Separating the SSI strategy,
    avoiding having to create both supply & demand (bootstrapping
    cost - typical in a platform)

-   Makes it easy to implements Privacy by Default

-   Transparency controlled by principals (doctors, patients) not by
    intermediaries

-   Non-sectoral; the same agent creates opportunities across
    industries/sectors

-   No corporate data aggregation

-   Building on top of object capabilities and delegation framework

-   A Identity-layered Internet allows for the development of new
    business models in a privacy-preserving way (decentralized Uber,
    decentralized eBay, decentralized AirBnB).

Weaknesses
----------

-   Introducing the holder into an incumbent verifier-issuer
    relationship adds a barrier or friction point in adoption.

-   Lack of upfront financing due to lack of platform (chicken & egg
    problem)

-   Are at risk of increasing transaction costs

-   Every technology can be used for good or bad and in many instances
    the first 'commercial' successes are for illicit purposes; quacks
    and fraudsters, are going to rise, potential for social media
    hysteria and significant shifting of market perception as a 'good'
    technology.

-   Correlation of agent endpoint (we need tumblrs, Tor, ...)

-   Cellphones, as a secure element, walled gardens of App stores

Opportunities
-------------

-   Redistributing the value (cost) of data brokers/intermediators to
    the principals (issuer, subject/holder, verifier)

-   Decentralization of policy making

-   Competition for governance

-   Authorization agent improves data quality - elimination of rekeying,
    provenance implicit, streaming, query, single of point of
    monitoring, policies stay private

-   Use of ZK proofs for reputation, nullification (e.g.: vote only
    once), data minimization

-   Globalization of medicine, the patient selects the jurisdiction of
    physician; decentralization of reputation and issuance (example:
    guilds vs states)

-   AI cost is 80% data and data cleansing, 10% data science and
    technology, 10% verification/validation (elimination/reduction of
    data brokers does not remove/limit AI)

-   Decentralization of AI to reflect SSI principles through Self
    Sovereign AI-enhanced agents based on federated AI

-   Standardized data governance labeling
    ([[http://bit.ly/PPR-IGL]](http://bit.ly/PPR-IGL))

-   Agent capability improves with greater API standardization within
    the market (API == data model)

Threats
-------

-   Will take \$2 Trillion out of US healthcare system

-   Platform mentality and political power of platform, through the
    vehicle of regulatory capture.

-   Need for standards, and lead times for standards

-   Market inertia,

-   May require governmental action (antitrust - oligopolies/monopolies,
    human rights of access and privacy)

-   Requiring change by multiple stakeholders (issuer, holder, verifier)
    categories magnifies barriers

-   Existence of government regulation (NIST reg's on regulated trust
    framework models), stakeholders may be willing to change, but
    regulatory inertia is overcome.

-   Data brokers are very large businesses, like icebergs, 90% hidden.

-   Crypto wallets get integrated natively into iOS and Android

-   Agents as a Service (AaaS) (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Telco's,
    ISPs)

-   Intel SGX, censorship

-   Elimination of data brokers requires an alternative for all of a
    particular dabroker's roles. Solutions may be required in as many
    as six use cases (reputation, matchmaker, transaction convenience,
    data brokerage, mapping data for a common ontology, and record
    retention)

-   Lack of business knowledge for industry participants

-   Collusion or Regulatory Capture - Direction is taken over by a
    limited number of private corporations that organize in "community
    groups", but do not truly represent commons or have a barrier of
    entry.

-   A self-sovereign identity wallet may have strong dependencies on
    Hardware provided security models (e.g. HSM\...) which may
    monopolize the market / undermine the self-sovereign principles of
    key and identifier control.

Barriers, Pathways and the Third Rail ("The hard way out?")
===========================================================

Barriers
--------

-   Want to bootstrap use without single entity dominance.

-   Non-traditional economic model; SSI model has by definition no
    equity upfront. All value is created in the Commons.

-   A Commons does generate enough equity for traditional finance models

-   Platform tokens have security regulatory risk

-   Surveillance capitalism has very low friction

-   Cultural norms (China) resistant to full agency (want backdoors)

-   India (Aadhaar) wants to centralize and maintain control of
    identifiers

Pathway Choices
---------------

### Desired End State

GPL Standards based code, in a cooperative based financial model, with
each coop on their specific policies while agreeing to allow any
individual or entity to exit the cooperative, start their own
cooperative or operate outside of any cooperative. ([[see Rochdale
Society]{.underline}](https://www.rochdalepioneersmuseum.coop/about-us/the-rochdale-principles/)
and seven principles of cooperatives)

### Community-driven Wallet reference implementation

Given the novelty and importance of the introduction of the holder
responsibility, the community should strive towards providing a
non-commercial wallet implementation to support this process and lower
the barrier to entry.

### AaaS First

Agent as a Service (AaaS) as an intermediate pathway before completely
moving the responsibility of the agent into the User space ("e.g. User
still recover my access via the centralized service, like he was used
to"). However, these services would need to be tightly regulated and
allow a seamless transition into a fully self-sovereign internet.
Regulation should aim at removing them altogether as soon as a critical
size has been reached.

The Third Rail
--------------

-   A megamerger of platforms across hosting, telecom, and payment
    creates the universal identity based on transaction surveillance.
    Regulating data use instead of regulating aggregation itself is a
    prescription for this disaster.

-   Apple fails at privacy by default

-   Private Telecom - 5G -\> where will mesh networks come from?
    (Regulatory Measures to give control to the owner of 5G enabled
    equipment, e.g. keys etc.)

-   Our children join corporate America (blind respect for authority and
    platforms) - e.g. the SSI Infrastructure needs "strong"
    holders/subjects. Private authority cannot deter bad behavior is
    an identity issue.

Conclusion
==========

-   Describe the most positive vision forward to reach the **"Desired
    State"**: Technology is created and supported out of cooperatives
    in favor of any other choices.

-   Desired State description: "In building adoption, it is key that the
    architects of that technology (\#SSI) do not inadvertently erect
    barriers to adoption. By taking a holder centric approach where
    the holders of credentials can select their wallet of preference
    and all issuers and verifiers can operate seamlessly."

-   Mention the possible need of transition steps/models.

-   In order to enable a Cooperative, both free software and open
    standards are required
