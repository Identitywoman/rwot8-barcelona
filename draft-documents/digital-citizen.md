# The Digital Citizen: Principles in collaborative mutual networks

By Siu Kei Chung, Shannon Appelcline, Ian Grigg, Jakub Lanc, Bill Tulloh, Ethan Brown

**Abstract**

*In an increasingly digitalised and decentralised world, how can we prevent the tragedies inherent in modern centralised internet architectures and ensure a fairer society driven by its very stakeholders? We propose ten core principles drawn from real-world examples that can guide the creation of mutual digital networks in the future decentralised network of systems and discuss how human identity plays a part.*


## I - Introduction

Our civilisation is based on strong relationships & hierarchical customs that have traditionally brought us harmoniously and productively together within tight physical domains such as tribes or cities. Yet today, we live in a world where Internet technology allows the most far flung of us to communicate as if we were together physically.

This new bounty of being able to communicate with practically everyone creates a tension - our brains were evolved many thousands of years ago within the context of small tribes, and it appears that we are not able to simultaneously maintain many more stable relationships than this. Dunbar and others have suggested an upper limit of about 150 connections. Beyond this, we humans establish separate groups, customs and heirarchical structures to improve our trust and capability to work together. 

These limits within the human brain underscore the dangers of this new frontier of digital collaboration. As more and deeper information is placed online, attackers of various forms collect the information and harvest the value outside the scope of fair collaboration and established custom, raising risks for the individuals and groups that imperil collaboration. Attackers are legion: governments, scammers, corporations such as the G-MAFIA, organised crime rings and lone hackers. Malicious third-parties exploit weaknesses introduced by the centralization of popular services on the internet, gaining access to collections of our information, which have been gathered together like gold in a vault. 

How did it become like this? While the web was initially designed as a decentralized system, federated approaches to network architecture have proven an expedient means to create the applications and services that are most popular on the Internet, and set user expectations about Internet use. These systems and expectations have typically been challenging to achieve using decentralized architectures. As a result, many of the capabilities of the internet today are tightly coupled to the companies that provide these services. We don’t really own or control our digital identities, yet we depend on them every day, and increasingly are inextricable from them.

We face a dilemma: we cannot go back, as the digital genie is decidedly out of the bottle. Yet our fundamentally best tool, our mind, is not inherently geared to a digital world. We must go forward, and in doing so perhaps we can also look backwards. We need to create the structures - legal, institutional, technical - that best protect and enable the individual and their community in digital space. 

As the technological underpinnings of a vibrant, commonplace cryptographic web of trust begin to take shape, we take a look in this paper at some ways that such networks may enable and create fundamentally new forms of group, as well as support groups that are not well-suited to the centralized networks of today and the role of identity within the groups and their formation.

In section II, we examine several examples of existing groups that might be best served by decentralized systems. 
In section III, lessons from these real-world groups are distilled into 10 core principles that illustrate some of the bases of robust, coherent, dynamic organizations.
In section IV, we explore how a combination of the core principles can lead to interesting emergent properties that we consider as further principles.
In section V, we briefly discuss the role of identity in such human organisation.


## II - Case Studies

New decentralized architectures present opportunities for novel group structures to emerge online, and are uniquely well suited to some forms of organization that already exist outside of the digital context. 

Traditionally on the modern web, when a group wants to organize, their only options are through technological means over which they have limited control, and under which they have a limited degree of privacy. Such an environment limits what forms of group may emerge. 

Decentralized and privacy-preserving protocols could enable new forms of digital group, wherein all entities who have privileges in a group are also explicitly members of that group. This suggests that such groups could explore a greater degree of freedom in self-determination.

In this section, we explore several real-world examples of groups that might be best served by such an architecture. 


#### 1. Chamas

In developing nations and immigrant enclaves, social savings groups form to manage one of their biggest challenges: corruption resulting in theft of savings. To counter widespread lack of security, groups of typically women come together on a regular basis to save and to invest money. As a group, they operate together, transparently and safely, and thus can collect, account, keep and build savings.

These groups, called chamas in Kenya, stockvel in South Africa, Hui in China and many other names, have a focused purpose. One minimal form simply rotates the money randomly like a lottery. More sophisticated forms save money over time for investments in working assets such as buses or businesses, or to provide the working capital for all the members.

These groups come together when they have no safe alternative. While people in more stable societies might choose banks or government-backed solutions, chamas serve groups who must closely determine who they trust, and who they do not. 

Decentralized, privacy-preserving protocols that enable groups to choose who may participate and exclude all others would consequently be a good fit for chamas. 

#### 2. Chatham House Rule

The ‘rule’ pioneered at Chatham House creates a special temporary shelter for freedom of expression within difficult circumstances. It is designed to encourage open discussion and sharing of information. The rule itself is quite simple:

“When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed".

The Chatham House rule place no restrictions on the participants’ internal discussion, but restricts what they can say externally. By limiting the release of identifying information, participants can freely express ideas that they would not wish to be associated with when taken out of that particular context.

Chatham House rule recognizes that the dialogue flourishes when it is both open and open-ended. Ideas that exist as part of an ongoing discussion have a different meaning when taken out of that context and fixed as single statement.

It also recognizes that the people involved in the discussion are multi-dimensional, playing many roles. Things said in one role may not have the same meaning when said by the same person speaking in a different role. Productive conversations depend on respecting the autonomy of the participants, and ensuring that they follow a peer to peer, rather than a hierarchical model.

Chatham House groups cannot function as intended unless all who participate are bound by the same rules. Furthermore, they must trust that only individuals who are subject to these rules may participate. 

#### 3. RWOT

Rebooting the Web of Trust is a cooperative design workshop that allows individuals to come together and produce collaborative white papers over the course of three days. It does so through an organizational process that first determines topics of interest to the community and then filters individuals into those groups, with this relatively structured process producing groups of like-minded individuals who are most likely to work together on a collaborative paper. Once organized into a group, the members largely stay within that group, though they may reach out to other groups and the larger community for advice, ideas, or specific knowledge.

Members of groups are encouraged to listen to each other and do their best to incorporate the ideas of individuals into the group, but as each paper comes to a conclusion, a Lead Author is given the authority to make final decisions about the paper; if an individual doesn’t like the decisions made by the lead, then he or she can choose to leave the group, removing his or her name from the final paper. This paper is the product of one such group from RWOT Barcelona 2018.

#### 4. Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a decentralised digital cash and payment system that allows users to join and run the network as well as transact on it. Entirely run by peers, the Bitcoin network cannot be censored by any one individual and its value is derived from and secured by the activities of a group called miners. Coins are minted and distributed by an unforgeable cryptographic proof which ensures the security and mutuality of the currency, allowing it to assume some perceived value to its members, an essential property of cash/money. By being decentralised, it is not controlled by any single entity and its existence itself is a collective will to maintain the network and its function.

Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner. Miners collectively upgrade their clients to include software updates, they can leave the network if they no longer want to participate, and the network can fork if a subset of the community wishes to run the network in a different way. This allows the group to simply divide and subdivide depending on the needs of any subgroup. The freedom of the group and protocol means that the Bitcoin network is entirely mutual and builds from the collective needs of the group primarily.

## III - Core Principles

In constructing a world for the digital citizen, there are a number of principles and assumptions from real-world examples that we would like to preserve in the networks that are built. The particular principles that we’ve focused on are drawn from the small group of use cases detailed here: others would certainly suggest additional principles.


#### 1. Purpose


The Purpose principle describes the intent of a community’s existence, which is built upon a set of common values. These values may or may not be explicitly stated but are represented by an agreed set of procedures that define how a community will interact to produce an intended output. This output is the express reason for the formation of such a community, but it may change if the common value set shared by its members change. A community may have multiple purposes that arise through community agreement. There may also be an agreed code of conduct that attempts to dispel behaviour that does not contribute to the purpose of the community or to better encourage the achievement of the purpose.

In chamas, members gather and pool funds together to facilitate a safer, more secure way to save funds in corrupt societies. This explicitly is the purpose of a chama and the sole reason for the creation of the community. The Chatham House Rule’s purpose is to provide an isolated environment for expression, to encourage those in more complex circumstances to air their comment in the safety of anonymity and non-affiliation. RWOT’s purpose is found succinctly in its name: to reboot the web of trust. Bitcoin’s purpose is to transact funds without dependence on a centralized authority.

#### 2. Conduct

Conduct requires that there be a set of rules, whether explicitly stated or not, for how the people in a community interact. It describes their behavior toward each other, other communities and the wider externalities as a whole. Communities are particularly strong when conduct aligns well with purpose.

In Chamas, there are specific rules for when loans are repaid and when money is put in and taken out, which help to ensure anti-corruption conduct. In the Chatham Rule, the conduct rules are equally precise, requiring the anonymization of personal information. Rebooting the Web of Trust requires conduct that ensures that everyone be heard. Bitcoin’s consensus rules ensure that everyone adds to the blockchain in the same way. In all cases these codes closely align with the purpose: to preserve funds, to ensure safety of expression, to sustain creativity, and to decentralize authority of function, respectively.

#### 3. Inclusion

Inclusion requires that everyone have a voice in the community. This is not the same as saying that everyone has a veto, simply that they’re heard. It also doesn’t state that everyone acts as peers (although that’s another principle, mutuality).

In Chamas, each member has a vote. Obviously, everyone can speak in a community ruled by the Chatham Rule, though it’s not a requirement of the system itself. In RWOT, ensuring that everyone is heard is a core rule of Conduct. On Bitcoin, everyone can add to the blockchain, with censorship-resistance a core part of the design.

#### 4. Mutuality

In order for all to contribute, it is important to preserve the equality of relationships as much as possible. When a person relates to another, that relationship should be balanced, bi-directional and equivalent to the extent reasonably possible or useful. While a good principle, this is not always possible. Where a relationship already includes some asymmetry, this cannot be remedied just by imposing mutuality. E.g., lender & borrower will display asymmetry of power and dependency.

In chamas, each member is entitled to the same savings and loans facilities. For the Chatham House Rule, members of corporations and regulators alike can rely that the other will not report their names as attributions to comments. Within this paper, each of our authors have contributed to one or more of these principles in various ways. On the Bitcoin blockchain, anyone can be a user or a miner, if they have the right equipment.

#### 5. Privacy/Transparency

Privacy for individuals today is almost directly dependent on the march to digitise all the things. As we become an increasingly Internet-dependent world, possibilities to amass more and more data increase, and opportunities to monetise that data are boundless. With Snowden, GDPR and Cambridge Analytica, it is no longer reasonable to ignore the commercial and state surveillance as a serious threat to society. Decentralised efforts have yet to show fruit. Chief among these is the dilemma of putting all our personal data onto a blockchain; even hashes of data are effectively considered a no-go by data protection regulators. Transparency should be upheld within the boundaries of the group in order to monitor the behaviour of the group and achieve appropriate accountability (principle 9). Privacy should be upheld such that confidentiality of the group and its activities are not made publicly available externally.

Chamas are formed to protect the privacy, and more specifically the financial safety by privacy of their savings. Chatham House Rule preserves the privacy of the individual, and thus the safety of the corporation or government department in sharing views and information. RWOT has in the past followed the guide of no attribution for quotes, but RWOT #8 saw a number of tweets pushed out. Bitcoin supports pseudonymity, where transactions can’t be correlated if a user practices good address hygiene.

#### 6. Freedom of Exit and Consensual Entry

Belonging to a community should be voluntary. Individuals should be able to exit communities that no longer meet their needs. For the exit option to be meaningful, they should have options to join communities and to form new ones. Communities, however, should have a say about who its members are, so such entry should be based on mutual consent. The exit option needs to be more than just the formal ability to exit or ‘right to leave’ -- it must address issues of the cost of exit, and the cost and availability of joining or creating new communities.

In Chamas, membership is by consent. The exit option is possible in principle, but in certain circumstances may not be practical. Participating in Chatham House Rule is voluntary. Participants can choose to participate, or chose to leave to form or join other discussion forums that follow Chatham House or a different set of rules. The low cost of implementing Chatham House Rule or others makes the exit practical. RWOT working groups are formed around common interests of participants, although there are occasional forced schisms and upsets. There’s little practical way to keep someone from entering the Bitcoin community, but it’s quite easy to exit: just sell your coins (or exchange them for another cryptocurrency).


#### 7. Skin in the Game

The amount of risk taken by individuals is generally correlated with the seriousness with which members participate, and therefore the strength of the group and its relationships. As an observation, this strength will flow into any secondary benefit of the group, for example the capability to deliver useful identity information such as verifiable credentials.

For example, a chama might hold the life savings of a family at risk, whereas a RWOT attendee might run the light risk of being excluded from future events. A Chatham House meeting would likely be formed of individuals within a sustained business such as banking and the long term reputation of each member would be at stake. Members caught announcing attributed statements could be ostracised, losing possibilities for communication, reputation and potentially their jobs and career paths. In Bitcoin, users have actual money at risk, and though the network is both pseudonymous and censorship resistant, it is possible to identify and censor “bad” money if the network works together.

#### 8. Incentives

People join groups to get benefits. Often tied to purpose, rewards can consist of titles, prizes, mentions, or direct profits. Incentives can be considered more broadly: Maslow’s Pyramid suggests that a sense of belonging and purpose leads to self esteem, creating an environment for further sharing. The wisdom of crowds says that the sum, the group decision, is better than the parts, the opinions of individuals.

Incentives and rewards can range from subtle to concrete. Chatham House Rule meetings provide the chance to informally exchange key opinions and information that would formally be kept hidden. Co-authors of papers from RWOT learn from each other and see their work spread broadly and influencing future work. Members in a chama may share profits from their joint investments according to their shares, or they may get their savings under control so as to get their children into fully paid private school. Bitcoin users can see the subtle benefits of pseudonymous, stateless transactions and the concrete benefits of increasing crypto-investments, if the currency is taken seriously.

#### 9. Accountability

Accountability is the flipside of incentives: although people are awarded for taking beneficial activities without a group, they also need to be held accountable, in some way, for harmful activities taken within the group. Accountability could be encouraged through disincentives, which can be as mild as transparency - everyone knows. There could be also be graduated punishments, starting with counseling, warnings, and fines. An individual could lose privileges with a community. At the ultimate level, an individual could be forced to exit a community; if this is an ultimate punishment, then there must be ways to ensure that the individual can’t return under another alias.

In Chamas, fines might be levied against minor conduct violations such as arriving late, and inability to repay loans can result in usurious interest rates or seizure of collateral. At a higher level, someone might be ostracized within the chama or even cast out of it, and these repercussions can also be mirrored in the larger community. Accountability is harder to ensure for a Chatham House Rule group because a violation is most likely to happen after the group breaks up, which means that ostracization within the larger community is the only real repercussion. RWOT maintains accountability primarily through light counseling on the one end and the possibility of forced exit on the other. (More generally, it’s a case where clearly defined Purpose and Conduct largely obviate the need for Accountability.) In Bitcoin, accountability is primarily achieved through transparency: except for networks with “confidential transactions”, everyone can see everything that is done on a blockchain; granted, pseudonymity can limit this transparency in practice.

#### 10. Membrane

A group always constructs a protective barrier around it to define who is in the group and who is outside. We term this barrier a membrane. It acts as a control to both the Consensual Entry and the Freedom to Exit the group, but it can also more subtly act as a filter for other elements trying to enter or leave the group, such as information. This membrane becomes a dividing element, separating the unit of the group from the outer world.

In Chamas, the membrane protects the community against the corruption around it; by choosing trusted peoples, the members of the Chama purposefully create a different environment than that which surrounds them. The membrane can also protect the financial plans of the chama, which they wouldn’t want revealed to competitors or attackers. In the Chatham House Rule, the membrane very explicitly protects information: identifiable information is not to pass through the membrane although it may be difficult to enforce. RWOT offers a more subtle example of a membrane: a group isolates itself from others mainly to preserve their attention and to keep the chaos of the much larger organization from infiltrating their group. With Bitcoin, a membrane is part of what makes the cryptocurrency community borderless: the protocol ensures separation from attackers, governments and other blockchains.

## IV - Emergent Principles

Observing adherence to these principles, we can imagine the kinds of behaviour that emerge from those in following of them. They give rise to further principles that may also become tenets in upholding the core ten. An individual may not meet the above principles alone, and individuals working together struggle to maintain consistent adherence to them. Groups can do this, but groups face their own problems; drifting purpose, takeover, inept accountability, exclusion from within and corruption. Many of these issues become worse at scale as trust becomes challenged (Dunbar’s Number);, indeed it is hard to see how a large-scale organisation can preserve the principles on behalf of all the users instead of to the benefit of itself: shareholder value, this year’s bonus, don’t be evil. Groups then have limits to scale and tend to either metastasize (cancer), to undergo mitosis (fork!) or to be eaten.

Forking is perhaps the best result amongst the many painful outcomes of a dynamic, real society. If groups cannot scale, they can fork, which perhaps we should celebrate. Forkism then becomes an emergent principle in support of the freedom of mutual communities and the natural evolution of human groups.

From forkism emerges a secondary principle of polycentrism. Within a larger context exist numerous varied groups where each group is created and self-governed by none other than its own members. In such an environment we see a landscape, not of centralised services and their users, but of independent groups and their governing, participating members where there are multiple centres of activity located at the nexus of each self-sovereign group. As we turn to construct a digitally decentralised analogue of self-forming communities in the wild it paints a picture of a digital world full of various decentralised networks.

Indeed, maybe the decentralised network is more of a network of many groups rather than an anarchy of individuals. An alternate to the dichotomy of centrism versus decentralisation is polycentrism: many small groups working together but living apart.

There is no scaling limit to the number of groups, but the interaction between groups then becomes critical. More and more powerful links makes for a more powerful community of groups. This opportunity is for several of the principles to be implemented with polycentrism in mind: the group preserves the privacy of the members, but the membrane allows useful edges to form between groups.

There is an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of the group to function and the ability for each member's voice to be heard as the group scales.This trade-off between protecting the individual and fulfilling the purpose of a group is an evolving dynamic that polycentrism supports. Solidifying the purpose of a group increases the productivity of the group (cite: Reed’s Law) but reduces the freedom of the individual. Assuming that each individual has unique but somewhat common needs, the group that is low in number is better able to cater for a set of common needs as there are less (possible conflicting) various requirements to be met by a single governing rule set under the group. Centralised services focus the decision-making of what needs will be met to a small subset of stakeholders which compromises the freedom of the individual. Decentralisation empowers the individual to seek out more appropriate options through freedom of exit to join other groups, creating their own or forking and splitting the now larger encumbered group into a more niche subgroup that better captures the common needs (and culture) of the individuals. This trade-off between a participant’s need for productive function vs freedom of choice is supported by the idea of dynamic polycentrism - a decentralised network of communities. Providing the capabilities and safety afforded to members of centralized structures to arbitrarily small agents in decentralized networks enables organizations with less existential threat and greater receptiveness to complexity. 

## V - Identity in Networks

The idea of digital analogues to the human need to seek out groups with common needs leads us to a digitally tangible construct of human organisation which is always a socially involved endeavour. The identity of the individual is a core part of the creation of a group - you would not create a group with individuals whom you do not know... or would you?

Identity is often a topic that quickly descends into philosophical realms - discussions that often bear less practical fruit. In this discussion however, we reason that "knowing" an individual is second to why you may necessarily need to 'know' them in the context of collaboration.

From an individualist perspective, it can be seen that we are each independent agents who are, simply put, incentivised differently. For this reason we will each act differently to fulfill our needs and more often than not this involves other people. Thus we interact with our fellow humans, yet in a model where we act with the sole purpose of bettering our own situation, we will only engage in interactions that we gain from, materially, emotionally or elsewise. Interactions become calculated choices that are evaluated by each individual as beneficial, and can often become a complex game-theoretic analysis that usually collapses to some intuition in practice, which may or may not be correct. Ultimately actions and interactions occur based on the individual's estimate of a positive outcome for themselves in some dimension.

Yet, that perspective of individualism might be just one more myth fighting for our attention, more suited to the young adult making her way in the world than other contexts. A more natural perspective might be the earlier years of upbringing in the family and the extended family, being natural and recurring groups.

Groups that form are primarily born from a need to scale productive function that no one individual could accomplish alone (principle 1: purpose). To fulfill such a goal, each mutual member only necessarily needs to know the identity of the others to the extent that it confirms to that member that they will benefit the fulfilment of the group's purpose. The group’s purpose will lie within the intersection of the needs of each member. Thus we reason that only a subset of the possible information about the identity of any individual is necessary per context, where a context is a situation that requires decisive action.

## VI - Conclusion

Humans are social and collaborative creatures, but also rivalrous for the same reasons. There is an innate need to find commonality in others to survive and be productive; harmonious communities can create positive-sum games in which every member benefits from the group. But there are always situations where not all individuals are recipients of positive outcomes.

A community will wish to scale in order to improve efficiency and productivity, better fulfilling the purpose of the group. However groups may suffer as they reach too large a size. Too many voices and the group may lose clarity of purpose; the degrees of freedom must shrink in order to maintain productivity, which can result in the capturing of individuals with diverging interests. The trade-off between freedom and productivity correlates to the size of the group. Smaller groups are more agile and adaptable to change, but larger groups are more effective due to pooled resources. These too are decided values that may be captured by the purpose of a group and the ability for it to change and evolve by freedom of entry, exit, formation, forking, governance and more allow for a more fluid model of human organisation in collaborative networks.

We learn from various examples of mutual communities in the wild and derive ten principles that aim to uphold the net positives of collaborative behaviour. It is shown through the lessons of the past how productive and mutually beneficial humans can be to one another. In the coming digitalisation of all things, human interactions become much more detached and removed, but faster and more direct. As communities move online and aim to decentralise our digital lives on to mutual networks like blockchains, it is more important than ever to ensure that we can build constructive and collaborative communities to pave the way to a functional, sustainable, decentralised way of life.

## Appendix: Elinor Ostrom’s Eight Design Principles of the Common Pool Resource

Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom in her 1990 book Governing the Commons identified a set of eight design principles used by successful communities for governing common pool resources. To provide a check on the design principles identified in this paper, we compare them to Ostrom principles.

Elinor Ostrom’s principles were developed by studying x# of successful efforts to manage common pool resources. Common pool resource systems -- like fisheries and grazing pastures, -- combine aspects of public and private goods. Traditional solutions for pure public goods (states) or pure private goods (markets) do not readily apply, as the resource system is public (the lake) but the resource units (the fish) are rivalrous. What she found is that communities can in many cases successfully self-organize governance systems that can successfully manage common pool resources.

The slightly revised list of principles taken from her (2010) Nobel prize lecture, “Beyond Markets and States: Polycentric Governance of Complex Economic” is:

1/ Boundaries
a/ User Boundaries: Clear and locally understood boundaries between legitimate users and nonusers are present.

b/ Resource Boundaries: Clear boundaries that separate specific common-pool resources from a larger social-ecological system are present.

2/ Congruence:
a/ Congruence with Local Conditions: Appropriation and provision rules are congruent with local social and environmental conditions.

b/ Congruence between Appropriation and Provision: Appropriation rules are congruent with provision rules; the distribution of costs is proportional to the distribution of benefits.

3/ Collective-Choice Arrangements: Most individuals affected by a resource regime are authorized to participate in making and modifying its rules.

4/ Monitoring

a/ Monitoring Users: Individuals who are accountable to or are the users monitor the appropriation and provision level of users.

b/ Monitoring the Resource: Individuals who are accountable to or are the users monitor the condition of the resource.

5/ Graduated Sanctions: Sanctions for rule violation start very low but become stronger if a user repeatedly violates a rule.

6/ Conflict-Resolution Mechanisms: Rapid, low-cost, local arenas exist for resolving conflicts among users or with officials.

7/ Minimal Recognition of Rights: The rights of local users to make their own rules are recognized by the government.

8/ Nested Enterprises: When a common-pool resource is closely connected to a larger social-ecological system, governance activities are organized in multiple nested layers.


Critique

Ostrom’s concept has similarities to our concept membranes, but is focused on mainly on exclusion - protecting communities from outside interference. Membranes emphasizes selective transport across boundaries in both directions. In addition, her design principles don’t address exit and entry across boundaries (although this addressed elsewhere in her work.)

Ostrom’s concept of congruence does not have an obvious counterpart in our system. This is due in part to the specific nature of common pool resources, but it also suggests a potential blind spot. Perhaps, related to congruence are our concepts of purpose and conduct. The rules of conduct of the community need to be congruent with the community’s purpose.

Ostrom’s concepts of collective choice and dispute resolution relates to our concepts of voice and mutuality. Collective choice mechanisms to determine community rules, along with dispute resolution for dealing with potential violations of those rules are aspects of voice. The principle of mutuality sets bounds on those mechanisms to ensure that they respect individual autonomy and avoid, as much as possible, power asymmetries. 

Ostrom’s concept of monitoring can be seen as one aspect of accountability. In common pool resources where extractable resource units are scarce, and overuse of the resource system can lead to its destruction, monitoring compliance with rules by monitoring the actions of users and the state of the resource are important function. More generally, members of a community need to be accountable to the other members and to the community’s purpose. 

Graduated sanctions are also identifiable in uses case we examine. They can be seen as one type of incentive system. The principle that these sanctions be graduated is an important aspect, especially in systems where banishment from the system imposes high costs on the banished. 

Ostrom’s seventh principle, the minimal recognition of rights - specifically, that the rights of local users to make their own rules are recognized by the government - can perhaps be rephrased, in our context as self-governance. Although his touches on several of our principles such as voice and mutuality, it relates directly to the importance of having skin in the game.

Ostrom’s final concept, nested enterprise, recognizes that specific communities may be parts of larger communities in resource systems. This is something that we don’t specifically address, rather we pick up on the notion of polycentric systems, also emphasized by Ostrom.

Interestingly, privacy is a principle identified by us that does not seem to have an obvious counterpart in Ostrom. This may in part be due to the specific challenges of managing common pool resources which differ from the challenges we face in protecting the digital person online.
